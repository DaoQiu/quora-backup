Rather than fetching your entire history of Quora activity all at once, quora-backup checks your recent Quora activity and saves only the new entries. **Run it regularly to maintain a full backup.** This not only allows backups to be performed faster and more frequently, but also makes less requests to Quora's servers and doesn't face request rate-limiting issues like some older backup techniques do. It supports backing up to **JSON and CSV**. More file formats and databases to come.\r\n\r\n### Table of Contents\r\n* [Installation](#installation)\r\n* [Usage](#usage)\r\n    * [Backup Formats](#backup-formats)\r\n    * [Specifying an Activity](#specifying-an-activity)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou will need [Python 2](https://www.python.org/download/).
